Recipes:
This contains a glaze recipe for dipping, pouring, and donuts; chocolate glaze, and an edible glue recipe.

Dipping Recipe:
You can use this to dip fruits, vegetables, or something like that.

First, add the powdered sugar to a bowl. The bowl should not be too small.
Then, slowly stir in the water. If you want a thin glaze, the consistency should be watery. If you want a thick glaze, don't add too much water.
Next, dip whatever you want in the glaze.
After that, set up a small wire cooling rack on a plate and place your dipped treats on it for the glaze to set. The extra glaze will drip on the plate and you can re-use it.

Pouring:
Use this recipe for things that only need glaze on the top(or any other side) like cinnamon rolls.

Use the dipping recipe but replace steps 3 and 4 with this:
Take a spoon and pour your glaze over what you're using.

Donuts:
For glazed donuts. You can use chocolate glaze (recipe below) for this too.

Replace steps 3 and 4 with:
Drop your plain donuts in the bowl. Use two forks to flip it. After the whole donut is covered (take a spoon and pour some around the inner ring of the donut, sometimes that doesn't get covered just by flipping), use the forks to keep it on a small wire rack places on a plate for the glaze to set.
If you are using 

Chocolate Glaze:

Use a thicker glaze and add a little bit of unsweetened cocoa powder to the glaze. Taste to check if the chocolate is the right amount.

Edible glue:

Add as little water as you can. The consistency should be very, very thick.

If you're eating this with pancakes/flapjacks/waffles, just pour a little bit on top.
