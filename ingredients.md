    This is the most important ingredient. For best results, use 

    store-bought; homemade will not be the consistency of actual powdered
    
    sugar and the glaze won't come out right. The amount of sugar you use
    
    is based on how much glaze you want.


2. Water
    
    Water
    
    You also need water. The amount you use depends on how much sugar you 
    
    use and that depends on the amount of glaze you are making.
